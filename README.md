# I almost get this one to work.

data gen py fails with minio localhost connect.
I connect to postgres and I do not see any data. 

The containers seem to start just fine, might be able to work through it.

# Change Data Capture

Repository for the [Change Data Capture with Debezium](https://www.startdataengineering.com/post/change-data-capture-using-debezium-kafka-and-pg/) blog at startdataengineering.com.

# Project Design

# Run on codespaces

You can run this CDC data pipeline using GitHub codespaces. Follow the instructions below.

1. Create codespaces by going to the **[change_data_capture](https://github.com/josephmachado/change_data_capture)** repository, cloning(or fork) it and then clicking on `Create codespaces on main` button.
2. Wait for codespaces to start, then in the terminal type `make up && sleep 60 && make connectors && sleep 60`.
3. Wait for the above to complete, it can take up a couple of minutes.
4. Go to the `ports` tab and click on the link exposing port `9001` to access Minio (open source S3) UI.
5. In the minio UI, use `minio`, and `minio123` as username and password respectively. In the minio UI you will be able to see the the paths `commerce/debezium.commerce.products` and `commerce/debezium.commerce.users` paths, which have json files in them. The json files contain data about the create, updates and deletes in the respective products and users tables.

**NOTE**: The screenshots below, show the general process to start codespaces, please follow the instructions shown above for this project.

![codespace make up](./assets/images/cs2.png)

**Note** Make sure to switch off codespaces instance, you only have limited free usage; see docs [here](https://github.com/features/codespaces#pricing).


# Prerequisites

1. [git version >= 2.37.1](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git)
2. [Docker version >= 20.10.17](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [Docker compose v2 version >= v2.10.2](https://docs.docker.com/compose/#compose-v2-and-the-new-docker-compose-command). Make sure that docker is running using `docker ps`
3. [pgcli](https://www.pgcli.com/install)

**Windows users**: please setup WSL and a local Ubuntu Virtual machine following **[the instructions here](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-on-wsl2-on-windows-10#1-overview)**. Install the above prerequisites on your ubuntu terminal; if you have trouble installing docker, follow **[the steps here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-22-04#step-1-installing-docker)** (only Step 1 is necessary). Please install the make command with `sudo apt install make -y` (if its not already present). 

# Setup

All the commands shown below are to be run via the terminal (use the Ubuntu terminal for WSL users). We will use docker to set up our containers. Clone and move into the lab repository, as shown below.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/josephmachado/change_data_capture.git
cd change_data_capture
```

We have some helpful make commands to make working with our systems more accessible. Shown below are the make commands and their definitions

1. **make up**: Spin up the docker containers for Postgres, data generator, Kafka Connect, Kafka, & minio (open source S3 alternative). Note this also sets up [Postgres tables](./postgres/init.sql) and starts a [python script](./datagen/gen_user_payment_data.py) to create-delete-update rows in those tables.
2. **make conenctors**: Set up the debezium connector to start recording changes from Postgres and another connector to push this data into minio.
3. **make down**: Stop the docker containers.

You can see the commands in [this Makefile](./Makefile). If your terminal does not support **make** commands, please use the commands in [the Makefile](./Makefile) directly. All the commands in this book assume that you have the docker containers running.

In your terminal, do the following:

```bash
# Make sure docker is running using docker ps
make up # starts the docker containers
sleep 60 # wait 1 minute for all the containers to set up
make connectors # Sets up the connectors
sleep 60 # wait 1 minute for some data to be pushed into minio
make minio-ui # opens localhost:9001
```

In the minio UI, use `minio`, and `minio123` as username and password respectively. In the minio UI you will be able to see the the paths `commerce/debezium.commerce.products` and `commerce/debezium.commerce.users` paths, which have json files in them. The json files contain data about the create, updates and deletes in the respective products and users tables.

# Analyze data with duckDB

We [mount a local folder to minio container](./docker-compose.yml) which allows us to access the data in minio via filesystem. We can start a Python REPL to run DuckDB as shown below:

```bash
python
```

Now let's create a SCD2 for `products` table from the data we have in minio. Note we are only looking at rows that have updates and deletes in them (see the `where id in` filter in the below query). 

```python
import duckdb as d
d.sql("""
    WITH products_create_update_delete AS (
        SELECT
            COALESCE(CAST(json->'value'->'after'->'id' AS INT), CAST(json->'value'->'before'->'id' AS INT)) AS id,
            json->'value'->'before' AS before_row_value,
            json->'value'->'after' AS after_row_value,
            CASE

                WHEN CAST(json->'value'->'$.op' AS CHAR(1)) = '"r"' THEN 'SNAPSHOT'
                ELSE 'INVALID'
            END AS operation_type,
            CAST(json->'value'->'source'->'lsn' AS BIGINT) AS log_seq_num,
            epoch_ms(CAST(json->'value'->'source'->'ts_ms' AS BIGINT)) AS source_timestamp
        FROM
            read_ndjson_objects('minio/data/commerce/debezium.commerce.products/*/*/*.json')
        WHERE
            log_seq_num IS NOT NULL
    )
    SELECT
        id,
        CAST(after_row_value->'name' AS VARCHAR(255)) AS name,
        CAST(after_row_value->'description' AS TEXT) AS description,
        CAST(after_row_value->'price' AS NUMERIC(10, 2)) AS price,
        source_timestamp AS row_valid_start_timestamp,
        CASE 
            WHEN LEAD(source_timestamp, 1) OVER lead_txn_timestamp IS NULL THEN CAST('9999-01-01' AS TIMESTAMP) 
            ELSE LEAD(source_timestamp, 1) OVER lead_txn_timestamp 
        END AS row_valid_expiration_timestamp
    FROM products_create_update_delete
    WHERE id in (SELECT id FROM products_create_update_delete GROUP BY id HAVING COUNT(*) > 1)
    WINDOW lead_txn_timestamp AS (PARTITION BY id ORDER BY log_seq_num )
    ORDER BY id, row_valid_start_timestamp
    LIMIT
        200;
    """).execute()
```
